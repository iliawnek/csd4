Known Plain Text Attack

key = 0x86C9
message = A day can really slip by when you're deliberately avoiding what you're supposed to do

Cipher Text Only Attack
-----------------------

key = 0xCF0D
message = For perfect safety... sit on a fence and watch the birds.

Theoretical number of cipher text blocks needed for unambiguous decoding:
  sac16 uses 16-bit keys, and we will assume that keys are chosen at random, so H(K) = 16.
  The plain text message is in English, so D = 3.2.
  N_u = H(K) / D = 16 / 3.2 = 5, so the unicity distance is 5 characters.
  Each block codes 2 characters.
  blocks needed = 5/2 = 2.5 blocks

Actual number of cipher text blocks needed for unambiguous decoding:
  Decoding one cipher block gives "Fo". This alone is not an English word.
  Decoding two cipher blocks gives "For ". This is a capitalised English word ending with a space.
  So 2 blocks are actually needed to unambiguously decode the cipher text.

Why they are different:
  The theoretical value is only an approximation for all potential English messages.
  An approximation implies no guarantee for complete accuracy.
  The actual value is only for this one specific message.
  It will likely be different for each message.
