Known Plain Text Attack

key = 0x86C9
message = A day can really slip by when you're deliberately avoiding what you're supposed to do

Cipher Text Only Attack
-----------------------

key = 0xCF0D
message = For perfect safety... sit on a fence and watch the birds.

Theoretical number of cipher text blocks needed for unambiguous decoding:
  H(K):
    sac16 uses 16-bit keys
    We will assume that keys are chosen at random
    Entropy of the keyspace H(K) = 16
  r:
    The plain text message is in English
    Actual rate r = 1.5
  L:
    I will assume that the message alphabet consists only of:
        A-Z
        a-z
        comma
        period
        space
        newline
    Number of characters in the alphabet L = 26+26+4 = 56
  R:
    Absolute rate R = log_2(56) = 5.8
  D:
    Redundancy D = R-r = 5.8-1.5 = 4.3
  N_u:
    Unicity distance N_u = H(K)/D = 16/4.3 = 3.7
  blocks needed:
    Each block codes 2 characters
    3.7 characters are needed
    blocks needed = 3.7/2 = 1.85

Actual number of cipher text blocks needed for unambiguous decoding:
  First N blocks of a message are deemed "valid English" if:
    All characters are in the previously-mentioned alphabet.
    All digrams are not in list of non-occurring English digrams (digrams.txt).
  At 7 cipher blocks:
    There are 4 messages whose first 7 blocks satisfy the "valid English" requirements, including the actual message.
    The 3 non-actual messages are close enough to the actual message to be readable and understandable.
    blocks needed for readable message = 7
  At 10 cipher blocks:
    Only the actual message is matched.
    blocks needed for only actual message = 10

Why they are different:
  The theoretical value only defines the absolute minimum.
  In practice, many more blocks are likely required to reliably break the encryption.
